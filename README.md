# Data Seperator for IoT

This repo is used to filter data from an mqtt history.

## Usage
To use this, the log files (starting with "log000") are moved to the rawdata folder. 
After running the script will ask for a filter. The filtered result is then saved in the result folder.

Attention: the filter is case-sensitive. Make sure that upper and lower case letters match.
